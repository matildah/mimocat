Mimocat protocol specification

Susan Werner <heinousbutch@gmail.com> 

Mimocat (as in "MIMO netcat") works like netcat (stdin of one netcat goes to
stdout of the other), except that it sends the data over more than one TCP
stream. This is primarily useful when you have multiple links between the two
machines in question and don't want / can't want to mess around with trunking
the links.
